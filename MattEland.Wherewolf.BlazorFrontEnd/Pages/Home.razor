    This application is an artificial intelligence experiment aimed at building AI agents to play
    Bezier Games' "One Night Ultimate Werewolf" game designed by Ted Alspach and Akihisa Okui.
</MudText>
<MudText Typo="Typo.body2" Class="mt-4">
    The goal of this game is to see how frequently an AI agent can fool a human player when
    playing as a werewolf - or how frequently AI agents can correctly identify the werewolf.
    The game is intended as an AI experiment and not a replacement for the physical version of
    One Night Ultimate Werewolf. As a result, the game can involve at most a single human player.
